# IMPORTANT
There's currently a security issue with database; it's saved in JSON and the tokens are plaintext.

I highly recommend to use this bot only if you trust the person/people who run it.

# Setup
Clone or download this repository to your folder.

Open config.json and enter your Discord bot's token. If you want, change the prefix.

Enter terminal or command line and navigate to your directory (the folder where you have the repository cloned)

Execute command `npm i` to install needed dependencies.

# Run
Simply execute `node core.js` (`node .` should work too)
